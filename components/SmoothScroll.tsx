 * Eased wheel scrolling, in the register Anduril and Relativity use: the page
 * carries a little momentum past the gesture instead of stopping dead.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, because taking over scrolling is the easiest way to
 * ruin a site:
 *
 * - **Mouse and trackpad only.** Touch already has momentum from the platform,
 *    and re-integrating it on top produces the drifting, unstoppable feel that
 *    makes hijacked scrolling notorious. Coarse pointers get native scroll.
 * - **Wheel only.** Keyboard (space, Page Down, arrows), scrollbar drags,
 *    find-in-page and scrollIntoView are all left to the browser. Anything that
 *    moves the page by a route we did not cause resyncs the target instead of
 *    fighting it — the failure mode otherwise is the page snapping back to
 *    where this component still thinks it should be.
 * - **Off under prefers-reduced-motion**, where added inertia is exactly the
 *    thing being opted out of.
 *
 * The gesture still travels the same distance it natively would: `deltaY` is
 * added to the target untouched, so this changes how the page arrives, never
 * how far it goes.
